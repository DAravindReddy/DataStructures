Arrays
int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};//if you want to modify the size it is not prefered using statically
int arr[100] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};

statically => memory wasted and it will lead to shortage

to avoid it dynamic allocation is came to the picture. It is time consuming process
->malloc, calloc and realloc is used to modify the size of array but it takes time.

***to overcome that issue linked list came to the picture.

Linked list:
-----------
Linked list is in the form of train.
->linear data structures. 
->sequence of nodes.
->each node have data and address.
->memory will allocate in different location.
->linked list ends with null pointer for last node address
->head is the starting address of node in linked list.
Head is a pointer which contains the address of first node of linked list.


=>slist is build with self referential structures:

struct structnode
{
	int value;
	structnode *add;
};
int main()
{
	struct structnode slist;
